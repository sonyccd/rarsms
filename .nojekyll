# This file tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing
# and serve the repository as static files only.
#
# This is useful for projects that:
# 1. Have their own static site (like index.html)
# 2. Want to avoid Jekyll build issues
# 3. Don't need Jekyll's templating features
#
# To use Jekyll instead, delete this file and keep _config.yml
